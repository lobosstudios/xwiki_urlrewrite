# xwiki_urlrewrite - XWiki Docker Image with Short URLs

This is an update to the original work at **Horten-Folkeverksted/xwiki_urlrewrite**. The original repo 
has been archived, with no commits for at least two years (as of today's date - 2023-06-29).

My goal is to keep this Dockerfile up-to-date, and compatible with as many XWiki LTS releases as possible.

Right now, this Dockerfile works with 15.5.0/MariaDB/Tomcat. I plan to add other XWiki versions and database/servlet container combinations as demand arises.

**If you want me to add an XWiki version/database/servlet container combo, please open an issue (if one does not already exist).**
